<br> <strong>Journey Of Struggle</strong> <br>


Due to the early death of your father Majeed, the gardener and other conditions of the house had deteriorated. Because of which you used to do the work of Zaraat along with the studies of Hazrat Qibla Piro Murshid and you used to fulfill the Akharajat of the house.

Mother Mohtarma took care of the house by farming and younger brother Sufi Abdul Wajid drove the bullock cart and Abdul Majid alias Bhaiya grazed the cattle.
<br>
Elder brother Hazrat Sufi Abdul Gani Sahab helped in completing the Akhra Jaat of the house by taking the job of schoolmaster after completing high school (matriculation). Due to this the situation at home started changing. You used to give father-like status to your elder brother. Your family is counted among the Mu'izz and the Sharfas of the city. Not only the people of the community, but other Hazrats also respect and respect you a lot.
<br>

<br> <strong>Mother Majida</strong> <br>

You are Hazrat Qibla Piro Murshid's mother Majida's Isme Girami Batul Begum who resembles Binte Rasoolullah Sallallaho Alaihi Wasallam.

Hazrat Qibla Piro Murshid used to love his mother Majida very much and took care of her every need. Similarly, your father passed away on 19th Zilhij.<br>
<br>
<br> <strong>Low Age And Miya</strong> <br>

Hazrat Qibla Piro Murshid Sufi Abdur Razzaq Shah Sahab was not interested in worldly works even in his young age. You would always be doing your studies or doing household chores. Even in the mosque, you used to remain engrossed in the remembrance of God. You had love for elders, deen and auliya Allahu from a young age. That's why you often used to worship a person whose city Dausa used to respect and respect Hazrat Sufi Mahmood Shah Sahib. Used to go to
<br>
Sufi Mahmood Mian who was a follower of Hazrat Sultanul Auliya Khwaja Sufi Mohammad Hasan Shah Qibla. Hearing the words and stories of Hazrat Sufi Mahmood Shah Sahab, a river of marefat started playing in your heart since childhood. Mahmood Mian used to say, Son (Hazrat Qibla Sufi Abdurrazzaq Shah Sahab), we will make you follow a scholar and Kamil Peer. After this, the yearning to see the Peer awakened in you.
<br>
You are the will of Sufi Mahmood Shah Saheb who in 1957 became Hazrat Qibla Saheb Sultanul Auliya Sufi Hakimuddin Shah Saheb. Sarfaraz got upset with this world at the age of just 35 years after bringing Dausa and presenting Gore Naib Trupti to the people of Dausa. Your celebration is in the Dargah of Hazrat Jamal Shah Sahab in Dausa.
<br>
<br> <strong>Bayat <br>

In whose destiny is the guidance of Murshid. <br>
May he pass safely even through Pulsirat. <br> </strong> <br>

When you would be 16-17 years old, you used to study in class eleven of worldly education. One day you heard that Hazrat Sufi Mahmood Shah Sahab used to mention the old personality. Hearing that they have brought that elderly Kamil from Ajmer Sharif to Dausa, your deep hearted love and affection, Sheikh started enjoying, after a while Hazrat Sufi Mahmood Shah Sahab came and
Served you in Bargahe Pirane Uzzam. You were impressed by seeing Piro Murshid, then at the same time you obtained permission to pledge allegiance to the group of Haq Parast of Mehbooba Sultanul Auliya Hazrat Qibla Sufi Hakimuddin Shah Sahab. 
<br> You Mehboob Sultanul Auliya hid this little innocent bud in the bosom of Faizan, the world of the heart which was deserted for a long time, became mustard in a moment. After this, Tasavvure Sheikh became a cover-up.
<br>
<br> <strong>nigahe karam hazrat sultanul oliya <br>

 

 <br> Nigahe marde momin mein woh tasir dekhi. <br>
Saw the fortunes of thousands changing. <br> </strong> <br>


 

Mehboob Sultanul Auliya Hazrat Qibla Sufi Hakimuddin Shah Sahib. Chants of Allah-Allah resounded in the city after Dausa Tashrif was brought. The effect of your spiritual attraction was that hundreds of people began to be happy by paying allegiance to your squad of Haq Parast and the caravan of Silsila-e-Alia Jahangiriyan kept on increasing. In the entire city of Dausa, the waves of spirituality started flowing.
<br>Your special eyes started falling on Inayat Hazrat Qibla Sufi Abdurrazzaq Shah Sahab, you started participating in every small and big work, while your age Sharif was very young at that time. Meanwhile, a program was made to bring Dausa Sharif Tasharif of Sultanul Auliya Hazrat Qibla Khwaja Mohammad Hasan Shah Sahab. Piro Murshid Mehboobey Sultanul Auliya Hasbe Dastur directed all the muridans to work in different trenches on Sultanul Auliya's Tasharif Awari and took some muridans along with them to the railway station.
<br>One of them was Hazrat Qibla Sufi Abdurrazzaq Shah Sahab. When the train reached the railway station and Sultanul Auliya met Khwaja Sufi Mohammad Hasan, Mehboob Sultanul Auliya
Hazrat Qibla Sufi Hakimuddin Shah Sahib and Murideen were jubilant. The fragrance of that Noorani personality started spreading everywhere. Mehboob Sultanul Auliya was his peer Murshid Sultanul Auliya Sufi Khwaja Mohammad Hasan Shah. By becoming Kadam Bose, he got the title of Dast Bossi.
<br>In the end, your beloved (Khusro) follower Hazrat Qibla Sufi Abdurrazzaq Shah Sahib also appeared in Sultanul Auliya's bargah and received Kadam Bossi's headscarf. At this time Sultanul Auliya Hazrat Qibla Sufi Khwaja Mohammad Hasan Shah remained. Were lying down. As soon as you saw our Piro Murshid Hazrat Qibla Sufi Dr. Abdurrazzaq Shah, Huzoor Sultanul Auliya's face lit up with happiness as if you had found some rare (priceless) thing and you Sultanul Auliya gave that little innocent bud 
Kissed your forehead with my lips in your mercy that you announced that the little bud will later be seen as a very big chaman in the courtship of Aaliya Jahangiriya. The effect of kissing the forehead of AAP Sultanul Auliya is still on his youth. Whoever appeared in Hazrat Sultanul Auliya Qibla's Bargah Aaliya with an open heart did not return empty handed.
<br>
<br> <strong>Khidmate Piro Murshid</strong> <br>


With great devotion and open love, you used to be present in the gatherings of Pirane Uzzam. Apart from studies, whenever you got time, you used to attend bargahs. Not even a single day used to happen that your Piro Murshid was in Dausa and you were not present.
<br>Apart from this, Piro used to be present in the service of Murshid throughout the night. Hazrat Mehboob Sultanul Auliya often used to suggest you studies. You used to pay special attention to your studies by following this order of your Piro Murshid. Even after the death of Peers Murshid, you often keep appearing on Aastane Sharif.
<br>
<br> <strong>the enchantress piro murshid</strong> <br>


Piro Murshid (Dr.) Hazrat Mian Sufi Abdurrazzaq Shah Hakimi Maddjillul Aali narrated an incident after Vishal in his own words about Mubarak Nawajishe Karam in the glory of his Piro Murshid. In the year 1989-90, when you were posted as Principal in Dausa School and you were about to be promoted to the post of District Education Officer. At that time people would tell you to get the recommendation done so that you get Jaipur district. You would smile and say after listening to their words.
<br>You appeared at the hands of your Piro Murshid Hazrat Qibla Ruhi Fida Huzoor Mehboob Sultanul Auliya Hazrat Khwaja Sufi Hakimuddin Shah Quddsirrahul Aziz and filed a complaint. In those days one night you got the good news that Piro Murshid Hazrat Qibla Roohi Fida Huzoor Mahbube Sultanul Auliya Hazrat Khwaja Sufi Hakimuddin Shah Quddsirrhul Aziz is attending the Khidmat Aqdas of his Piro Murshid Huzoor Sultanul Auliya Hazrat Khwaja Mohammad Hasan Shah Quddsirrhul Aziz.
Let my Razzaq stay with me in Dausa. (At that time Dausa was included in Jaipur district) At that time Huzoor Sultanul Auliya Hazrat Khwaja Mohammad Hasan Shah Quddasirrhul Aziz raised his hands for prayer and these words were issued from your words.
<br>Ya RasoolAllah After this, Huzoor Sultanul Auliya Hazrat Khwaja Mohammad Hasan Shah Quddsirrhul Aziz said to Huzoor Mehboob Sultanul Auliya Hazrat Khwaja Sufi Hakimuddin Shah Quddsirrhul Aziz, “Now be happy”. After a few days of this Khwabe Azim's blessings, you got the post of District Education Officer, Jaipur.
<br>
<br> <strong>The storm was doing the Tawaf of my Ajm. <br>
The world was thinking that the boat is in the whirlpool. <br> </strong>

<br> <strong>permission and opposition  </strong> <br>


In 1960, Hazrat Mahbube Sultanul Olia Qibla gave you the Jahangiri Taj and made you Sarfaraz with permission and Khilafat. The work of decency of Aaliya Jahangiriya in Rajasthan is inspired by the dignity of Marshide Girami Mehboob Sultanul Auliya, but it originated through you. Alhamdulillah uroj baraye silsila continues, and insha Allah ta'ala it will continue further (Ameen).
<br>Hazrat Khwaja Sufi Arbdur Razzaq Shah Qibla's Ismegirami is mustahab to be written in golden letters on the first page of the date of Alia Jahangiriya in connection with the revelations of Mahbube Sultanul Auliya. The manner in which you have engaged yourself every day in the Ishaat of Silsila-e-Alia Jahangiriya with honesty, openness, love, hard work and dedication, you are an example of yourself. Undoubtedly, Aaliya's reliable and trusted Hazrat is proud of your caste.
